Hisilicon mbigen device tree bindings.
=======================================

Mbigen means: message based interrupt generator.

MBI is kind of msi interrupt only used on Non-PCI devices.

To reduce the wired interrupt number connected to GIC,
Hisilicon designed mbigen to collect and generate interrupt.


Non-pci devices can connect to mbigen and gnerate the inteerrupt
by wirtting ITS register.

The mbigen and devices connect to mbigen have the following properties:


Mbigen required properties:
-------------------------------------------
-compatible: Should be "hisilicon,mbi-gen"
-msi-parent: should specified the ITS mbigen connected
-interrupt controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value is 2 for now.

  The 1st cell is the interrupt number(Hwirq).This value depends on
  the Soc design.

  The 2nd cell is the interrupt trigger type, encoded as follows:
		1 = edge triggered
		4 = level triggered

- reg: Specifies the base physical address and size of the ITS
  registers.

Examples:

	mbigen_pa: interrupt-controller@4c030000 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,mbi-gen";
			msi-parent = <&its_pa>;
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			reg = <0x4c030000 0x10000>;
		};

Device connect to mbigen required properties:
----------------------------------------------------
-interrupt-parent: Specifies the mbigen node which device connected.
-interrupts:specifies the interrupt source.The first cell is hwirq num, the
  second number is trigger type.

Examples:
	usb0: ehci@a1000000 {
		compatible = "generic-ehci";
		interrupt-parent = <&mbigen_pa>;
		reg = <0xa1000000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <20 4>;
	};
