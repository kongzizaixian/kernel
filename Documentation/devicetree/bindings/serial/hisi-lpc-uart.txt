* Hisilicon DesignWare lpc UART

Required properties:
- compatible : "hisilicon,16550-lpc-uart"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.

Clock handling:
The clock rate of the input clock needs to be supplied by one of
- clocks : phandle to the input clock

The supplying peripheral clock can also be handled, needing a second property
- clock-names: tuple listing input clock names.

Optional properties:

- reg-shift : quantity to shift the register offsets by.  If this property is
  not present then the register offsets are not shifted.

Example:

	uart1: uart@02f8 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,16550-lpc-uart";
		reg = <0 0x02f8 0x0 0x100>;
		clocks = <&refclk18461mhz>;
		clock-names = "clk";
		reg-shift = <0>;
	};
