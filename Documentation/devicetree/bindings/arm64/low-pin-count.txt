Low Pin Count bus driver

Usually LPC controller is part of PCI host bridge, so the legacy ISA
port locate on LPC bus can be accessed directly. But some SoC have
independent LPC controller, and we can access the legacy port by specifying
LPC address cycle. Thus, LPC driver is introduced.

Required properties:
- compatible: "low-pin-count"
- reg: specifies low pin count address range

Example:

	lpc_0: lpc@a01b0000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
                compatible = "low-pin-count";
                reg = <0x0 0xa01b0000 0x0 0x10000>;
        };
