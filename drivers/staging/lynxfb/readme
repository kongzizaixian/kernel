1,How to build the kernel with driver source code
	assume you have a kernel source folder named "linux-2.6.30" 
	and the driver folder named "electra". below are the steps:

	1.type "cp ./electra linux-2.6.30/driver/video/lynxfb -r" to 
	copy driver souce code beneath kernel folder.	 

	Notes: 	for not picking up the wrong driver folder, be aware that
		the files under folder electra should contains 
		"lynx_drv.c","lynx_hw750.c","ddk750","ddk712",etc...

	2.add below section into linux-2.6.30/driver/video/Kconfig
	( recommend to add to tail of "FB_INTEL_I2C" section):

#**********************************************************************
config FB_LYNXFB
	tristate "SMI lynx sm750/718/712/722/502 display support"
	depends on FB && PCI
	select FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	---help---
	  This driver supports graphic board with the siliconmotion
	  sm750/sm718/sm712/sm722/sm502. Say Y if you have such a 
	  graphic board.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the 
	  module will be called lynxfb.
	 
#***********************************************************************


	3.add below line into linux-2.6.30/driver/video/Makefile :
		obj-$(CONFIG_FB_LYNXFB)	+= lynxfb/

2,How to build the driver without kernel source code  (we prefer this 
	method)

	assume you have the electra source folder,just goto that folder 
	and type "make" will get you the kernel module named "lynxfb.ko"
	driver will be built according to the kernel version you are cu-
	rrently running. use modinfo ./lynxfb.ko to check it.

	*NOTE*:
	If you are running a v2.6.32 linux and you also got v2.6.38 header
	files under "/lib/modules/2.6.38/build" folder.
	You can type "make kernel=2.6.38" to build the driver based on
	the specific "2.6.38" version kernel (instead of previous method,
	which will always build the driver based on the kernel version
	you are running).	

3,About the parameter of make:
	"make debug=2" will generate all debug information to console/tty
	"make debug=1" wil generate all debug information to dmesg
	"make" will not generate any debug information

4,About the kernel module paramter of driver
	For lynxfb kernel modulem, the paramters are all wrapped with 
	a string passed to the lynxfb.ko, for example:

	A,Use 1280,8bpp index color and 60 hz mode:
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="1280x1024-8@60" 

	B,Disable MTRR,Disable 2d acceleration,Disable hardware cursor,
	and use a 800x600 mode :
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="noaccel,nomtrr,nohwc,800x600"

	Notes#1:If you build the driver with built-in method, the paramter 
		you edited in the grub config file will be also the 
		same format as above module method
		just add "video=lynxfb:" before the parameter string
e.g.:
linux /vmlinuz-2.6.30 root=uuid=xxx video=lynxfb:noaccel,1024x768-32@60


	Notes#2:if you put 800x600 into the paramter without bpp and 
		refresh rate, kernel driver will defaulty use 16bpp and 60hz

	Notes#3:hardware cursor has been closed by default for SM712/SM722.
		User can enable it by use option "usehwc".
5,The specific driver parameter depends on chip will be explained in furture.
